/*
 * This module is designed as a simpler version of our old localStorage
 * utility.  To reduce potential bundle size, it doesn't make use of Obj
 * utilities or wlog, and doesn't return early based on browser detection.
 *
 * To avoid multiple tab bugs, it does not try to do any kind of commit
 * debouncing. Every call to `set` involves JSON.serialize() and every call to
 * `get` involves JSON.parse(). Therefore, if you are performing many
 * operations, you should cache an intermediate value. The
 * updateLocalStorage function is also provided for doing many updates
 * with a single parse and serialize call.
 *
 * If you are working with localStorage on something that requires lots of
 * updates, you should use a separate namespace. That way there is less to
 * deserialize and serialize on each read and write.
